                  This study draws on 16 in-depth interviews with current and former journalists, and one expert on
                  journalism, equaling 17 total. I selected respondents based on their qualifications, location, and
                  current role; transcripts were manually verified, anonymized with aliases, and coded using the
                  flexible coding method.

                    Four main topics arose as central in my interviews: the journalism profession, the business model,
                    the impacts of digital technology, and regulatory and programmatic responses. Entering the
                    interviews, I had three general conjectures, all of which were at least partially disproven; the
                    story is much more complicated, and solutions are sparse.
